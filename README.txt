# reviewbasedrating
Required Softwares: 1)Anaconda navigator (or) pycharm

		    2)Visual studio code for user interface

Project files list: 1)Dataset: data2.csv
		
		    2)Machine learning code: PROJECT.ipynb

		    3)Modified dataset: preprocessed_reviews2.csv

		    For User interface

		    1)HTML file: index.html

		    2)Python files: app.py, review.py

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:

	People leave message and share their feelings online.
	Accurate sentiment analysis not only allows customers to better understand the product, but also enables the company to get better feedback from the market.
	This project aims to predict the ratings based on the reviews.
	In this project we are using Natural Language Processing and machine learning algorithms to predict the rating.


STEPS OF EXECUTION:

1)	Initially set up the jupyter notebook.

2)	Create a ipynb file in your desired location.
 
3)	Write all the ML code from PROJECT.ipynb
 
 
 

4)Open visual studio code.

5)Create a folder named front end with the files given as below.
 


6)Write the code from review.py (it is the same ml code)

7)Select the interpreter.(click ctrl+shift+p in vscode)

8)Debug the code and execute so that we don’t have any errors.
(we are considering xgboost because we got better accuracy for that algorithm)

9)Write the code from app.py.

10)Write the code form index.html.

11)Run app.py.

12)Open index.html in browser.

13)Enter the review.

14)Click on predict button and find the rating.
